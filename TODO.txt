load_samples:
- fix: ribo parser raises an error when using samples_list/Brinkman
- use same file name for ribosome_db and sequence_db (file extension) -> otherwise ribo parser in compute_signatures won't work

HGTransfer + compute_signatures:
- better compatibility in file location between each other ?

compute_signature:
- why two args for ribo in find_potential_HGT ? -> see load_samples: pb in ribo parsing and file names

other:
- what difference between reference.txt and yaml ? How to use them ?
- update readme
